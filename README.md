## About
This project was created for me to learn typescript.
With it I can learn various resources such as Destructuring, Arrow Functions, Promise, Modules and much more. In addition to exclusive features such as Decorators, Generics and Interfaces.
I learned about more advanced features and also how to set up workflows with TypeScript. This includes a TypeScript-only workflow as well as workflows using Gulp or Webpack.
